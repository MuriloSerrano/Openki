### What is Openki?

Openki is an open education platform. Courses can be proposed, discussed, developed, organized and published. The focus is on the promotion of self-organization, the bringing together of people, groupings and initiatives, and ensure a barrier-free exchange of experiences and knowledge. The courses are accessible to all, regardless of their financial situation. The organization behind it is non-profit and OpenSource.

  [Here] (http://about.openki.net/) you will find more about Openki and its philosophy and [here] (http://about.openki.net/?page_id=1216) on the basic concepts behind the platform.

### What does the name "Openki" actually means?

Openki is an Ukranian word (опеньки), and is part of a mushroom or fungus commonly known as honey fungus. or [Armillaria mellea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillaria_mellea).
The name Openki refers to the [mycelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycelium) of this fungus, which is the part of a fungus not normally considered when talking about a "mushroom". It consists of thousands of thin threads that form a dense net below ground. In the case of Openki, this can be as large as several square kilometers and hundreds of tons.

Many plants are connected by such mycelial threads. They need these to germinate, for food exchange or even to communicate with each other. Above the earth's surface, the fruit bodies of the mushrooms pop up unexpectedly and unpredictably.

An openki is fed on both living shrubs and trees, as later on from their dead organic material. On the philosophical level, the networks of Openki mycelium are a metaphor for an alternative model of education and knowledge exchange. It forms the hierarchical branch and root structure of the ancient Greek knowledge tree, in which subject areas are separated and subordinated, and connects them to become a horizontal network of knowledge.


### Who owns Openki?

Openki belongs to me, to you and to all who participate in it. The application is open source, is available under the [GNU AGPL license] (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.de.html) and is therefore freely available for non-commercial use. Behind Openki is the collectively organized non-profit association "KOPF", which has been developing Openki during the last years.


### Is Openki a social network?

Yes and no. We provide a tool for self-organization. Social contacts naturally belong to this. Comparing to other providers of social media, however, we want you to stay hooked on our web site only for a little time, and then invest as much time as possible to organize collective learning processes in the real world with nice people, like you.


### What is an Openki-course?

An Openki course is much more than a typical "classroom" course, and it can include discussions on the participants' content and goals, as well as the engagement of mentors and the organization of events. Like a ship, all participants can control the course and continuously influence and change the goal. The types of possible courses could range from lectures, traditional lessons, workshops, discussion and working groups to alternative education projects and reading groups.

An Openki course can start simply as a "suggestion": Somebody introduces a concept - an idea, a wish, a question. Other people can "participate" in the course, which means to stay informed and join when the course takes place. A mentor might appear in and and a venue offered by someone else. As soon as a course leads to its first planned event, "it takes place". A course can be one-time or repeated, build on other courses, or stand alone.

### What is a group?

Groups are already existing organizations, communities, etc., which use Openki to organize their courses.

### Why can not I ask for a fixed price as a mentor?

We believe that education (and thus the events on Openki) should be accessible to all - regardless of one's bank account and income.
